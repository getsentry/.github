## Reporting Security Issues

If you've found a security issue in Sentry or in our supported SDKs, you can submit your report to `security[@]sentry.io` via email.

Please include as much information as possible in your report to better help us understand and resolve the issue:

- Where the security issue exists (ie. Sentry SaaS, a Sentry-supported SDK, infrastructure, etc.)
- The type of issue (ex. SQL injection, cross-site scripting, missing authorization, etc.)
- Full paths or links to the source files where the security issue exists, if possible
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof of concept or exploit code, if available

If you need to encrypt sensitive information sent to us, please use [our PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x641D2F6C230DBE3B):
